## 🌟 Inspiration

Picture this: you’re signing up for something online, and bam—there’s a 10-page privacy policy staring you down. Total gibberish, right? Most of us just click “agree” and hope for the best. But deep down, we wonder: *What are they really doing with my data?* Add to that the sketchy websites with suspicious popups and fake offers—it's a digital minefield.

**VortexWatch** was born out of this frustration. We wanted to give users a tool to reclaim control over their online safety, starting with the one thing we all ignore: privacy policies.

## 🔍 What It Does

VortexWatch is your browser’s built-in privacy detective. It does the following:

- ✏️ **Scans privacy policies**: Automatically finds and reads the privacy policy on any site you visit.
- ⚠️ **Highlights shady lines**: Calls out vague or suspicious data-sharing statements.
- 🔢 **Gives a safety score (1–10)**: Based on AI analysis of both the policy and the site's code.
- 🐛 **Analyzes site HTML**: Flags strange scripts, popups, or suspicious behavior.
- 🕵️ **Labels websites**: `Safe`, `Suspicious`, or `Unsafe`.
- 🔍 Suggests safer alternatives: In case you really need that sketchy site’s functionality.
