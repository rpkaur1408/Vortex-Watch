## üåü Inspiration

Picture this: you‚Äôre signing up for something online, and bam‚Äîthere‚Äôs a 10-page privacy policy staring you down. Total gibberish, right? Most of us just click ‚Äúagree‚Äù and hope for the best. But deep down, we wonder: *What are they really doing with my data?* Add to that the sketchy websites with suspicious popups and fake offers‚Äîit's a digital minefield.

**VortexWatch** was born out of this frustration. We wanted to give users a tool to reclaim control over their online safety, starting with the one thing we all ignore: privacy policies.

## üîç What It Does

VortexWatch is your browser‚Äôs built-in privacy detective. It does the following:

- ‚úèÔ∏è **Scans privacy policies**: Automatically finds and reads the privacy policy on any site you visit.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Highlights shady lines**: Calls out vague or suspicious data-sharing statements.
- üî¢ **Gives a safety score (1‚Äì10)**: Based on AI analysis of both the policy and the site's code.
- üêõ **Analyzes site HTML**: Flags strange scripts, popups, or suspicious behavior.
- üïµÔ∏è **Labels websites**: `Safe`, `Suspicious`, or `Unsafe`.
- üîç Suggests safer alternatives: In case you really need that sketchy site‚Äôs functionality.
